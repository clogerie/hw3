Homework 3 assignment

I created a web page that generates a random password for the user. 
All character types (uppercase, lowercase, numeric, & special) are stored in variables.
Once the user clicks generate password they will be asked a series of questions.
The answers to those questions are also stored as variables.
A function was used to generate the password.
